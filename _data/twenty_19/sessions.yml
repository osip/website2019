  title: "PreLight"
  description: "The recent appearance of preprint servers in the biological sciences has revolutionised the publishing landscape and the opportunities available to scientists wanting to disseminate their work. Indeed, the submission of a preprint bypasses the long delays associated with traditional journal publications, the exhorbitant costs associated with the process, the paywalls and embargoes imposed on the final product. Testifying of the success of such new publishing strategies is the exponential growth of the number of research papers uploaded every month to preprint-servers such as bioRxiv. Yet, how can scientists stay on top of such a rapidly accumulating new stream of literature? I will share my experience as a writer for preLights, an online platform driven by early career researchers in the biological sciences, highlighting preprints of interest, and bridging the gap between authors and their readership."

  subtype: presentation
  description: "A key assumption in research, that unfortunately doesn't always hold true, is that published results are reliable and reproducible. In support of this, the goal of the reproducibility challenge is to investigate reproducibility of empirical results. We participated in the 2019 edition of the challenge, and evaluated results submitted to the 2019 International Conference on Learning Representations (ICLR), without any source code available. We will share how we participated with our 2-month paper reproducibility project, won the challenge, presented it at ICLR 2019, and got published in a journal. We will show you how you can participate in future editions of the challenge and can help make science more reproducible!"

In this workshop we will take a look at some open data sources and show how we get from raw data to visualization. This creative process can be applied to many types of data and we will see a few examples. In a second step, we will use Python and Jupyter notebooks to create our own story around an example data set."

  description: "In a scientific era that is coined by the phrase “Publish or perish” employing Open Science can be a balancing act. While the increasing complexity of research questions require tools that are accessible by everyone, the dedication of resources to maintenance, documentation and community building is not always a given. Maximilian will discuss how principles of Open Science can be implemented with the lessons learned from employing open-source software and hardware in the field of microscopy that he experienced throughout his Ph.D. Here he performed DNA-PAINT super-resolution microscopy that can achieve nanometer resolution in biological targets and contributed in building the Python Picasso software package for analysis. He will highlight the benefits of sharing code, publication strategies and how to maintain a community."

  description: "RENKU is software designed to make reproducible open science painless. RENKU does not re-invent wheels; it builds on proven, widely-used solutions, such as Docker for capturing execution environments and git for version control, but combines them together into a cohesive package. In this presentation, we will look at the perspective on Open Science that motivates RENKU and see examples of the tool in use to understand the benefits it brings to data analysis projects."

  description: "There are many good reasons to open source a library but the journey to open source may feel painful on various aspects. Open sourcing done right requires efforts on several fronts like packaging, testing, documentation or code clarity in general. However, it turns out that there is a lot to gain in the process as some of these efforts get converted into good practices. Making choices that incentivize people to use and contribute to your work will eventually benefit both the community and you as the maintainer."

  description: "A container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings. Containers can be used to package entire scientific workflows, software and libraries, and even data. This means that you don’t have to ask your cluster admin to install anything for you - you can put it in a container and run or easily share your analysis with collaborators. Containers are particularly useful way for reproducing research which relies on software to be configured in a certain way, and/or which makes use of libraries that vary between (or don’t exist on) different systems. There are a number of different tools available for creating and working with containers, and this workshop will focus on Docker and Singularity. "

  subtype: presentation
  description: "Figures and graphs are one of the most useful ways to understand and analyze data in every scientific field. A nicely crafted picture can help yourself to better understand the data that you are investigating and, later on, it can convey much more information than a mere block of text. At the same time, a bad visualization of the data can lead to incorrect or biased interpretations. In this workshop, I will present various examples of data visualization in the neuroscience realm, identifying bad behaviors, and proposing some guidelines and best practices for data visualization. Finally, we will see how to share reproducible and interactive figures that can integrate the traditional journal paper that you are going to publish."

  subtype: presentation
  description: "Getting insight from scientific data is not always a straightforward process. Data is often hard to find, archived in difficult to use formats, poorly structured and/or incomplete.  These issues create friction and make it difficult to use, publish and share data. The Frictionless Data initiative at Open Knowledge Foundation aims to reduce friction in working with data, with a goal to make it effortless to transport data among different tools and platforms for further analysis and with an emphasis on reproducible research. In this workshop, participants will learn about different sources of friction in working with scientific data and how to alleviate them using the open source Frictionless Data tools. This hands-on workshop is aimed for novices, but advanced programmers are also welcome."
