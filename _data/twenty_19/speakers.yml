His new book, “Collecting Experiments - Making Big Data Biology”, questions what knowledge is, how it is produced, to whom it belongs, and who can be credited for producing it. His first book, “La fabrique d’une nouvelle science: La biologie moléculaire à l’âge atomique, 1945-1964”, explores the emergence of molecular biology as new scientific discipline and professional identity in the atomic age. He has established and is leading an outreach lab, the Bioscope, at the University of Geneva."

  description: Lilly is the product manager for the Frictionless Data for Reproducible Research project. She has her PhD in neuroscience from Oregon Health and Science University, where she researched brain injury in fruit flies and became an advocate for open science and open data. Lilly believes that the future of research is open, and is using Frictionless Data tooling within the researcher community to make science more reproducible. In her free time, you can find Lilly running, hanging out with her dogs, or reading sci-fi.
  #abstract: Getting insight from scientific data is not always a straightforward process. Data is often hard to find, archived in difficult to use formats, poorly structured and/or incomplete.  These issues create friction and make it difficult to use, publish and share data. The Frictionless Data initiative at Open Knowledge Foundation aims to reduce friction in working with data, with a goal to make it effortless to transport data among different tools and platforms for further analysis and with an emphasis on reproducible research. In this workshop, participants will learn about different sources of friction in working with scientific data and how to alleviate them using the open source Frictionless Data tools. This hands-on workshop is aimed for novices, but advanced programmers are also welcome.

Alongside his research, Stefano writes for preLights, a pre-print highlight service run by the Company of Biologists. Prelighters are early career researchers selecting and highlighting preprints of interest from the hundreds `that are published online every month. PreLights put the research into context, highlight the main points of relevance, and allow the preprint authors to provide additional information about the work they have published.
  #abstract: The recent appearance of preprint servers in the biological sciences has revolutionised the publishing landscape and the opportunities available to scientists wanting to disseminate their work. Indeed, the submission of a preprint bypasses the long delays associated with traditional journal publications, the exhorbitant costs associated with the process, the paywalls and embargoes imposed on the final product. Testifying of the success of such new publishing strategies is the exponential growth of the number of research papers uploaded every month to preprint-servers such as bioRxiv. Yet, how can scientists stay on top of such a rapidly accumulating new stream of literature? I will share my experience as a writer for preLights, an online platform driven by early career researchers in the biological sciences, highlighting preprints of interest, and bridging the gap between authors and their readership.

  #abstract: Figures and graphs are one of the most useful ways to understand and analyze data in every scientific field. A nicely crafted picture can help yourself to better understand the data that you are investigating and, later on, it can convey much more information than a mere block of text. At the same time, a bad visualization of the data can lead to incorrect or biased interpretations. In this workshop, I will present various examples of data visualization in the neuroscience realm, identifying bad behaviors, and proposing some guidelines and best practices for data visualization. Finally, we will see how to share reproducible and interactive figures that can integrate the traditional journal paper that you are going to publish.

He was the co-organizer  of  many  large-scale  machine  learning  competitions,  such  as  NeurIPS  2017:Learning to Run Challenge, NeurIPS 2018:  AI for Prosthetics Challenge, NeurIPS 2018:Adversarial Vision Challenge, and the 2018 MarLO Challenge. During his Ph.D. at EPFL, he worked on numerous problems at the intersection of AI and health, with a strong inter-est in reinforcement learning.  In his current role, he focuses on building better engineering tools  for  AI  researchers  and  making  research  in  AI  accessible  to  a  larger  community  of engineers."

  description: "Arnout is doing a PhD in Computer Science (CS) at EPFL, supported by a Marie Skłodowska-Curie fellowship. His research focuses on increasing the versatility of machine learning systems, mainly to learn with very small data. Previously, he did machine learning research at Stanford University, and obtained a Master’s in CS at the University of Southern California (BAEF fellow), and a Bachelor’s in EECS at KU Leuven."

  topic: "“But I don’t want people to steal our work!” and other stories about open-source code"
  description: "I have been working in the field of computational biology for almost 5 years now, both in the industry and in academia, the latter as a PhD student. As you probably already guessed, computational biology involves computers and science, and computers in science often involve code. I have worked with people from different fields, with different sensibilities to the problem of code, open science, and open source. Hopefully, telling you about my stories will give you some ideas to deal with the hardships of promoting open science, and make you turn an optimistic eye to the future."
